Python Input & Calculation Practice 🐍

This repository contains simple Python practice programs focused on user input, basic arithmetic, and formatted output.
It’s designed for beginners who are getting comfortable with Python syntax and console interaction.

📌 Practice 1: Area of a Rectangle

This program:

Takes the length and breadth of a rectangle (in cm) from the user

Calculates the area

Displays the result clearly

Concepts used

input()

Type casting (int)

Arithmetic operations

Formatted output

📌 Practice 2: Simple Shopping Calculator

This program:

Asks the user what item they are buying

Takes the price per item

Takes the quantity

Calculates and displays the total cost

Concepts used

input()

Type casting (float, int)

Variables

String formatting with f-strings

Mad Libs Story Generator 🐍🎭

This repository contains a simple Mad Libs–style Python program that creates a short, funny story using words provided by the user.

The program demonstrates how user input can be combined with string formatting to generate dynamic text output.

📌 What This Program Does

Prompts the user to enter:

Adjectives

An animal

A verb

An adverb

A noun

Inserts the user’s inputs into a pre-written story

Prints a complete, customized story to the console

Each run produces a different story depending on the inputs.

🧠 Concepts Used

input() for user interaction

Variables to store user data

f-strings for formatted output

Basic string manipulation

Sequential program flow

This is a classic beginner exercise to understand how programs can respond creatively to user input.
