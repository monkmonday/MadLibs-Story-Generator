Mad Libs Story Generator 🐍🎭

This repository contains a simple Mad Libs–style Python program that creates a short, funny story using words provided by the user.

The program demonstrates how user input can be combined with string formatting to generate dynamic text output.

📌 What This Program Does

Prompts the user to enter:

Adjectives

An animal

A verb

An adverb

A noun

Inserts the user’s inputs into a pre-written story

Prints a complete, customized story to the console

Each run produces a different story depending on the inputs.

🧠 Concepts Used

input() for user interaction

Variables to store user data

f-strings for formatted output

Basic string manipulation

Sequential program flow

This is a classic beginner exercise to understand how programs can respond creatively to user input.

▶️ How to Run the Program

Make sure Python is installed

Clone this repository or download the file

Run the script using:

python main.py


Enter the requested words when prompted

Enjoy your custom-generated story 🎉

🎯 Purpose of This Project

Practice Python input handling

Learn string formatting using f-strings

Build confidence with interactive console programs

Create something fun while learning fundamentals

🚀 Possible Improvements

Add input validation

Store multiple story templates

Randomize story structure

Turn it into a loop so users can play again
